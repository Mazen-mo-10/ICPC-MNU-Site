    question: "What is the Time Complexity of the Binary Search algorithm?",
    options: ["O(n)", "O(n log n)", "O(log n)", "O(1)"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "The Binary Search algorithm divides the search space in half each time, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity of O(log n).",
  },
  // more challenges can be added here
